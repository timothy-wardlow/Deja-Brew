  ## USER STORY/OVERVIEW:

I would like an application   

THAT allows me to purchase coffee beans from an E-Commerce website  

AND saves my profile information through a sign up page   

SO that my I can purchase and have the items shipped to me through the website.  

  ## Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN that I'm in a role of a registered customer  

WHEN I open the application I am welcomed through a sign up/login page.  

THEN the application shows me potential coffee beans to purchase and have shipped to me.  

AND the individual products will allow me to add the products into a cart saved
onto my account.  

THEN the site will ask me if I wish to order coffee beans that were purchased in previous orders.  

AND the site will have a search box to display results for coffee beans matching the search criteria.  

THEN after adding product items to your cart, there will be a checkout page where the user can add purchase/shipping information to buy and ship products to the consumer.
