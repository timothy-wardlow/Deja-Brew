## User Story
I would like an application   
THAT allows me to purchase coffee beans from an E Commerce website
AND saves my profile information through a sign up page   
SO that my I can purchase and have the items shipped to me through the website.  


## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN that I'm in a role of a registered customer
WHEN I open the application I am welcomed through a sign up/login page.  
THEN the application shows me potential coffee beans to purchase and have shipped to me.  
AND the individual products will allow me to add the products into a cart saved
onto my account.  
THEN the site will ask me if I wish to order coffee beans that were purchased in previous orders.  
AND the site will have a search box to display results for coffee beans matching the search criteria.  
THEN after adding product items to your cart, there will be a checkout page where the user can add purchase/shipping information to buy and ship products to the consumer.
